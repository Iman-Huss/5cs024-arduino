## Valve Application For Liquids In Virtual Enviroments System

### About:

During our second year of studies at the University Of Wolverhampton we chose a remotely controlled valve system as our development project. This repository contains the fruits of our labour.

The system is designed to control an arduino based stepper motor system to open and close valves remotely from a web interface. The hardware automatically stores all open/close, test cases and errors to an SQL log which it then displays over on the tables page. We've also made use of charts to help visualise the data.

### License Information:

This software/hardware is our own product and is the sum total of 13 weeks of rigorous testing, developing and debugging.

As such any implimentation of our code without our permission is intellectual theft. 

As students we're more than happy to teach you about our code, how it works and what each part does. To do so, feel free to contact us. You can email Iman on: i.hussain7@wlv.ac.uk - He will then be able to assist you.

Feel free to observe the code and if any future employer's are reading this, hello, you made the correct decision in shortlisting me/us (delete necassary).

With that out of the way, thank you for taking your time to read this document. We appreciate your time greatly. If you have any feedback feel free to get in touch :)

Kind Regards,
Iman Hussain On Behalf Of Group08

Hey guys, welcome to the Group 08 repository!

If your developing the website, dump your files and folders in their exact structure into the PHP folder.
If your developing for the arduino unit dump your files/folders into the Arduino folder.

Any questions? Whatsapp the group chat!
